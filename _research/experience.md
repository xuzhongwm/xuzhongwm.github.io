## 📁 Research Projects

### 📌 1. Reconfiguration Problems in Graph Theory
**Mentor:** Professor Gexin Yu  
**Description:**  
Studied the reconfiguration of 3-colorings and k-colorings in various classes of graphs including trees, 2-degenerate graphs, and outerplanar graphs.  
- Explored upper bounds on the diameter of recoloring graphs.  
- Investigated known results and proposed new proof techniques for constrained cases.  

**Tools:** LaTeX, ArXiv, Overleaf, Zotero
