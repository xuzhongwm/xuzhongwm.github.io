  <p>
    This is a GUI-based clone of the popular word game <em>Wordle</em>, built using <strong>pure Java</strong>.
    The game randomly selects a five-letter word, and players have six attempts to guess it. After each guess,
    the program provides feedback on correct letters and their positions, mimicking the original Wordle gameplay mechanics.
