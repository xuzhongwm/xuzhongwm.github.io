Akita is a computer architecture simulator engine. It allows experimentation with new ideas in computer architecture. Please refer to its documentation for more information: https://akitasim.dev/docs/akita/.

My contribution to Akita mainly focuses on data recording. With a unified data recording interface, Akita achieved recording simulation data in a single SQLite database file.
