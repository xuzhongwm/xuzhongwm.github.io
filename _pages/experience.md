## 📁 Research Projects

### 📌 1. Reconfiguration Problems in Graph Theory
**Mentor:** Prof. Gexin Yu  
**Description:**  
Studied the reconfiguration of k-colorings in various classes of graphs including k-degenerate graphs and mad(G) less than certain constant
- Explored upper bounds on the diameter of recoloring graphs.  
- Investigated known results and proposed new reducible structures for constrained cases.
