Hey, my name is Xuzhong Wang. I am an undergraduate student at William & Mary with a passion in math and computer science. This site is my portfolio, featuring projects, research, and ideas I'm exploring. My current interests lie vastly across graph theory, accelerated computing, and ml with a focus on rl and llms. Please feel free to contact me if you have anything that you would want to discuss.
